# Computer Vision - Course Assignments

`FaceRecognition/` contains the final assignment, a Facial Recognition System. Please refer to the specific README file within this directory for detailed information about the final project.

`*.py files` are all the individual Python files corresponding to different homework assignments done over the course. Each Python file is named according to the topic of the assignment.
- In the case of `Homework VII - mnist.py`, results are included in the Python file at the bottom. It has been seen that AveragePooling performs worse than MaxPooling both during training and testing. I believe this is probably because AveragePooling is not able to capture the most important features of the image, which are the edges. MaxPooling, on the other hand, is able to capture the edges and hence performs better than AveragePooling.
